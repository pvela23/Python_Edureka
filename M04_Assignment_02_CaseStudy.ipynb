    "Bank of Portugal runs a marketing campaign to offer loans to clients. The loan is offered to only clients in selective professions.\n",
    "A list of successful campaigns (with client data) is given in the attached data set. You must come up with a program that reads the file and builds a set of unique profession lists. Based on the given input professions of the client, the system tells whether the client is eligible to be approached for the marketing campaign.\n",

    "Key issues\n",
    "Tele Caller can only make x number of cold calls in a day. Hence to increase her effectiveness only eligible customers should be contacted.\n",

    "Considerations\n",

    "Business benefits\n",
    "The company can achieve between 15% to 20% higher conversion by targeting the right clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach to Solve\n",
    "You must use the fundamentals of Python taught in Module 3.\n",
    "1. Read file bank-data.csv\n",
    "2. Build a set of unique jobs\n",
    "3. Read the input from the command line â€“ profession\n",
    "4. Check if the profession is on the list\n",
    "5. Print whether the client is eligible\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancements for code\n",
    "You can try these enhancements in code\n",
    "1. Compute max and min age for loan eligibility based on data in csv file.\n",
    "2. Store max and min age in the dictionary.\n",
    "3. Make the professional check case insensitive.\n",
    "Currently program ends after the check. Take the input in the while loop and end only if the user types \"END\" for profession."
